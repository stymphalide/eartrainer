# Help
In order to be able to play the game, you first need to understand the game [set!](#set!). We have modified the features of the original set game such that the visual features are replaced by auditive ones.

## Set!
Set is a game with 81 cards. Each card is unique and has a certain **shape**, **colour** , **number** and **filling**.

The possible shapes are:
- rectangular
- oval
- squiggle

The possible colours are:
- red
- green
- purple

The possible numbers are:
- 1
- 2
- 3

The possible fillings are:
- empty
- striped
- filled

These are therefore all possible cards:
![Set All Cards](http://pics.livejournal.com/6_bleen_7/pic/0006pq54)

A set is now defined as three cards, where:
- *They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.*
- *They all have the same colour or have three different colours.*
- *They all have the same number or have three different numbers.*
- *They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.*

One important fact, is that any set is uniquely defined with just two given cards.

Let's say we have the following two cards:
- rectangular, green, 1 empty
- squiggle, purple, 2, striped

Then with the rules for a set we can see that the third card must be:
- oval, red, 3, filled

If you understood this example then you're almost ready to play our game.

## Eartrainer

The game has four different levels, but all follow the same principle. You will be presented with ten questions. In every question you get two *intervals*, those intervals act like the two card from the above example. 
However, instead of pictures you will get a generated sound clip to listen to. Like in the original game you will have to distinguish four features. This time, however, they will be *auditive*. 

### The Features
Let's cut to the chase, those features are:
- Instrument
- Order
- Range
- Interval Size

The *Instrument* and *Interval Size* feature vary for every level, however the *Order* and *Range* stay the same.

The *Order* has the following features:
- upwards
- downwards
- chordal

where chordal means played at the same time.

The range is built by splitting up in 
- high
- middle
- low. 

While these are qualitative features we mean specific ranges, namely
- C2-B3
- C4-B5
- C6-B7

However, most of the time it suffices to think about high middle and low. Depending on the range it may be that you hear different instruments. This is why we usually refer to a group of instruments as one instrument. For example the instrument *Strings* consists of violine, viola and cello each played in the ranges high, middle and low respectively.

### Level Specifications
The Levels have the following instruments/interval sizes:
#### Level 1
- Piano, Strings, Brass
- Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, Perfect Octave

#### Level 2
- Piano, Harpsichord, Organ
- Minor Second, Major Second, Minor Third

#### Level 3
- Harpsichord, Strings, Double Reed
- Intervals: Major Third, Tritone, Minor Sixth

#### Level 4
- Saxophone, Double Reed, Brass
- Major Sixth, Minor Seventh, Major Seventh

## How to play
So for every interval you need to determine the four features and the you need to think of the remaining features that are needed to finish the set. 

### Let's see an example:
Let's assume you have chosen level 1:

In the first question you get two buttons, first you press the first one. You being very good at hearing intervals immediately know:

This is a *piano*, playing a *perfect fourth*  *upwards* in a very *low* range.

Next you listen to the second interval and you hear:

A *brass* instrument, playing a *perfect fourth* *downwards* in a *middle* range.

Now you have four comboboxes, each comboboxes give you the possible answers for each feature.
Since the *Instruments* varied we have to choose the third one, which is *Strings*. Then we heard the interval being played *upwards* and *downwards*, therefore the third interval would have to be played *chordal*. The third feature is the range, since one was *low* and the other one *middle*, the third one must be *high*. The interval size must be equal to the other two since you heard twice the same interval, a *perfect fourth*.

Then you press the confirm button and that's it!

Happy listening!
